## Finish rate of first fight on UFC card

While watching mixed martial arts fights (and playing daily fantasy sports) I've noticed when that the first fight of the night on a UFC card usually ends in a finish (doesn't go to the judge's scorecards).
Or, I've developed a negative bias, as I'm usually staring at my DraftKings lineup after the fight fight wishing I had done research into the lesser know fighters appearing in the first fight. I mean, think about it...It would be strange if I had a similar belief for, say, the fourth fight on the card.

I want to investigate this further, as I have not confirmed the finish rate is any different than any other fight position on the card.
My hypothesis: the fighters who fight first on a card are likely newcomers to the UFC (or relatively new). They have found success in smaller organizations that do not have the talent pool of the UFC.
Thus, these fighters may have tremendous differences in skill level, resulting in a mismatch.
Let's see if this hypothesis can be supported with the data.
